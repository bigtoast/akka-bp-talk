/**
 * For non trivial state machines combining domain and runtime state in
 * a single actor state machine can lead to complex, buggy and unmaintainable 
 * code. This is generally due to the amount of blocks in the receive 
 * partial function. Although this example is very simple, I hope it shows
 * how to model a domain state machine contained in a runtime state machine. There
 * are many, many ways to model state machines with actors: FSM, become/unbecome and
 * partial function composition.
